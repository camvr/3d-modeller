3D MODELLER

A basic 3D modelling application that allows the user to create and model, subdivide, import and export quad-based meshes.

ABOUT

This is the final project for SFWR ENG 3GC3 at McMaster University.

The developer team is as follows:
- Cameron Van Ravens
- Nathan Coit
- Tommy Tran
- Alex Trudeau


BASIC USAGE:

- Create a basic cube or sphere by clicking on the cube or sphere icon on the top left tool bar. If you
need more vertices to model with then click on the grid icon to subdivide the mesh.

- The tools work by clicking and dragging with the left mouse button. The resultant movement is a little bit weird,
as other issues took up the time for implementing movement parallel to the view plane. Dragging the mouse vertically will
have affect in the Y-axis, whereas moving horizontally will have affect along the X/Z axis, dependent on the viewing angle.

- The tool movement can be locked to only move along a certain axis by pressing the corresponding key (x, y or z). A prompt
will show on the screen which axis is locked.

- You can have multiple objects in a scene. However, the object must be selected (using the selection tool) in order to have
any actions apply to it (i.e. saving, moving, sculpting, deleting, etc.). The selected object has a red outline along its edges.

- The camera is rotated with the right mouse button, and if you hold "shift" and the use the right mouse button, you can pan
the world view. The scroll wheel will zoom in and out.

- The middle click menu has extra options such as material selection, tool selection, and tool radius.


NOTES ABOUT THIS SOFTWARE:

- When saving or loading to or from a file, the program expects the file name to be entered in on 
the command line (including the .obj file extension). This takes over the main thread of the program
and if you attempt to do anything with the window the program will crash.

- Selection of multiple vertices can be a bit glitchy with higher subdivisions. This fixed (sort of) by lowering
the tool selection radius in the middle-click menu.

- Face normals are used solely due too strange issues where vertex normal calculations would only work on windows,
but not on Linux or Mac. We could not come up with a solution due to time constraints.
